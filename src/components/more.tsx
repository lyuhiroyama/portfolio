                            <br/><br/>
                            I felt very intrigued and inspired, which basically led me to try out some coding in <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freecodecamp</a>, a free tutorial website (I did have some prior experience with HTML/CSS from high school). 
                            <br/><br/>
                            I then went on to study that field at the University of the Fraser Valley, coding both in and outside of class.

                        answer={<>
                            I think a lot of things. In no specific order:
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The not knowing of what's possible. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Watching myself do something I didn't know I could do.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I genuinely enjoy it for the sake of it.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            But ultimately:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    It's what I find myself doing. I never have to tell myself to code.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            And so it was naturally fitting that I pursue this as a career!

                        answer={<>
                            I approach it differently depending on:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How deep I want to, or need to go in understanding the underlying details.</li>
                                <li>How time-sensitive it is.</li>
                            </ul>
                            I generally prefer to really get into the <a href="https://cuddly-sunflower-42d.notion.site/Ruby-on-Rails-0-1e9828fc96918009bd35f972ab38500c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details of things</a>, but if it's time-sensitive I won't get too deep into it.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            If it involves anything safety critical that I can't mess up, then that is also another big consideration.
                            <br/>
                            I then take measures (e.g. preparing test environments, understanding the effects of running certain processes beforehand), while also minding how much time is being spent.

                            I've been enjoying lifting weights and riding the stationary bike the past year!
                            I also like to play basketball and skateboard sometimes, but not often.
                            But I do follow them both!
